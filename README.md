## Project Overview

The Airbnb Clone Project is a comprehensive, real-world application aimed at replicating a robust and scalable booking platform, similar to Airbnb. 


### Frontend
The frontend will focus on building a functional web application for users to interact with. This includes creating a user interface where people can browse property listings, view detailed information for each property, and complete the booking process. The goal is to provide a smooth and intuitive user experience that replicates the look and feel of a professional booking platform.

<br />

### Backend
The backend will be built to serve as the core of the application, managing all the data and logic. Using **Django** and **PostgreSQL**, the project will create a scalable platform that handles everything from user management and property listings to bookings, reviews, and secure payments. All of this will be exposed through a **RESTful API**, ensuring the backend is robust and reliable.
