### Project Overview


The Airbnb Clone Project is a comprehensive, real-world application aimed at replicating a robust and scalable booking platform, similar to Airbnb. The goal is to create a scalable platform for property rentals with features like user management, property listings, bookings, reviews, and secure payments. For its backend, the project will specifically utilize Django and PostgreSQL, adhering to established RESTful API principles.
